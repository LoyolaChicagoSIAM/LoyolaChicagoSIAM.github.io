Students attended a seminar featuring Dr. Zeyu Zhou from Carl Zeiss X-ray Microscopy, Inc., where he provided an in-depth discussion on computed tomography (CT) and its applications. CT is a widely used imaging technique for non-destructive imaging in fields such as medical diagnostics, industrial inspection, and scientific research.

Dr. Zhou gave a comprehensive overview of the scientific principles and mathematical foundations of CT, explaining how X-ray projections are acquired and reconstructed using key techniques. He discussed reconstruction algorithms, phantom calibration, and artifact removal, which are essential for producing accurate imaging results. The seminar also highlighted real-world applications of CT, including image denoising and defect analysis, demonstrating its significance in both research and industry.

The talk provided valuable insights into the role of CT in various fields, helping students understand both the theoretical and practical aspects of this powerful imaging technology.
