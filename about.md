Our goal as Loyola University Chicago SIAM Student Chapter is to foster a community of students and researchers interested in using mathematics to solve complex challenges across various industries, including engineering, technology, data science, and finance. Through workshops, guest lectures, research initiatives, and networking events, we aim to:

1. Provide an environment in which to socialize and to exchange mathematical and technical ideas via speakers, informal discussions and seminars, social events and so forth.
2. Provide information about career and postgraduate opportunities in applied mathematics and mathematically-oriented fields.
3. Expose Loyola students to the SIAM community, so that they learn about the variety of local/national/international conferences organized by SIAM, well-regarded SIAM journals, etc.
4. Enhance understanding of applied and computational mathematics.
6. Encourage interdisciplinary research and collaboration.
